Before attempting to run the application, you need to add the .env file into the
/connorbennettonboardingtest/connorbennettonboardingtest-backend
directory. This file was included in the email I sent to submit this. Then do the
following to run the application:

Simply run the following from within the connorbennettonboardingtest directory:

"npm i" in order to install all dependecies, then run
"npm run dev" to start the application in development mode

It is not pixel perfect but this is what I was able to put together in a timely manner and wanted to get you guys a product to review ASAP

My implemetation consisted of me adding all of the profiles to MongoDB first, then implementing the pulling of the profiles from MongoDB. I then worked on the frontend, trying to make it look as close to the page on Figma as possible. Then went to work on the pulling and displaying of the profiles from MongoDB. After that, I worked on the filtering features and the smaller changes to the frontend.
